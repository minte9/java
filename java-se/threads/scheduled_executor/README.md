### ScheduledExecutorService

ScheduledExecutor is a `specialized` ExecutorService that can:

- Run tasks after a delay
- Run tasks periodically (fixed rate or fixed delay)

Before `Java 5`, developers used Timer / TimerTask.  
There was a single thread and one bad task could kill the timer.  

SchedulerExecutorService `fixed` all of this.  
Think of it as an Executor + timer + thread pool.
