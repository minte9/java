### Deadlock

A deadlock is when two (or more) threads are `stuck forever`,  
each waiting for the other to release a resource.  

The program doesn't crash, it just `hangs`.  
Real-world analogy:

~~~sh
Thread A locks Account 1
Thread B locks Account 2

Now:
A wants Account 2 -> waits for B
B wants Account 1 -> waits for A
~~~

~~~java
/**
 * Deadlock Example
 * ================
 * Two threads lock resources in different order.  
 * This creates a circular wait - DEADLOCK 
 */

public class DeadlockExample {
    
    public static final Object account1 = new Object();
    public static final Object account2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Runnable t1 = () -> {
            synchronized (account1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: locked account1"); 
                sleep(100);

                System.out.println("Thread 1: waiting for account2");
                synchronized(account2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1: locked account2");
                }
            }
        };

        Runnable t2 = () -> {
            // acquire locks in the WRONG order, different from t1 (deadlock)
            synchronized (account2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: locked account1"); 
                sleep(100);

                System.out.println("Thread 2: waiting for account2");
                synchronized(account1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: locked account2");
                }
            }
        };

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(t1, "T1");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(t2, "T2");
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        /*
            Thread 1: locked account1
            Thread 2: locked account1
            Thread 1: waiting for account2
            Thread 2: waiting for account2

            ... and then nothing (program freezes)
        */
    }

    private static void sleep(int miliseconds) {
        try { 
            Thread.sleep(miliseconds); 
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    } 
}

### FX system (example)

To avoid a deadloc, always lock in the `same` order.  
Avoid nested locks when posible.  

Here is a bank transfer example that `avoids` deadlock by  
always locking accounts in the same order.

~~~java
/**
 * Deadlock-safe bank transfer
 * ===========================
 * Problem:
 *  - Transfer needs to lock TWO accounts.
 *  - If two threads lock accounts in different order, deadlock can happen. 
 * 
 * Solution:
 *  - Always lock accounts in a consistent order.
 *  - Here we lock by account ID: smaller first, bigger second.
 * 
 * Real systems:
 *  - This is just an example (for simulations)
 *  - A bank is an ecosystem of services, it uses database transactions!
 * 
 * Transaction (PostgreSQL, Oracle):
 *   BEGIN;
 *   SELECT balance FROM account WHERE id=1 FOR UPDATE;
 *   UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 100;
 *   COMMIT;
